                Some App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with
                non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of a mobile app) can
                only be disabled by uninstalling the app. To uninstall an app,
                follow the instructions from your operating system or handset
                manufacturer. Apple and Google mobile device settings have
                settings to limit ad tracking, and other tracking, but these may
                not be completely effective.

                Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain
                kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive
                other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected,
                participating members should no longer deliver certain
                interest-based advertising to you but does not mean you will no
                longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other
                ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject

                browser or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g.,

              practices), “right to request deletion of personal information,”
              or “right to opt-out of the sale of personal information,” you can

              or toll-free at 833-720-0427. You have the right to not receive
              discriminatory treatment in a manner prohibited by the CCPA
              because of exercising your rights under the CCPA.
            </p>
            <p>
              To fulfill your CCPA request, we may require you to provide
              sufficient information to reasonably verify you are the Consumer
              about whom we collected PI. This verification process includes
              providing us at least two (2) unique data points, depending on the
              type of request.
            </p>
            <p>
              Consumers have the right to exercise CCPA privacy rights via an
              authorized agent who meets the agency requirements of the CCPA.
              Authorized agent requests must include a copy of the agency
              agreement between the authorized agent and the consumer. We will
              ask the consumer to independently confirm the agency relationship.
